/**
 * Replacement interface for the {@link IGenerator} that adds support for parallel code generation.
 * 
 * Clients of {@link IGenerator} that want to perform the code generation in the background will check for this
 * extension interface and use {@link #beforeGenerate(Resource, IFileSystemAccess2)} to prepare the resource set. That
 * is, implementors may alter the state of the resource set in the before hook. This may happen implicitly by resolving
 * proxies or explicitly by loading new resources into the resource set. No changes are allowed while
 * {@link #doGenerate(Resource, IFileSystemAccess2)} is executed since this may be parallelized by the caller. The
 * {@link #afterGenerate(Resource, IFileSystemAccess2)} is used to cleanup state. Also access to the file system is
 * guaranteed to be synchronous in the before and after hook.
